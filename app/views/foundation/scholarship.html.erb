<h1>Foundation Scholarships</h1>
<p>Clara Barton Foundation has several named Scholarship Endowments supported by generous donors. An endowment is a restriction on the use of donated funds. Endowment differs from regular donations in that the money creates a forever fund that is never spent. However, the earnings on the investment help the donor’s chosen cause now as well as far into the future, remembering the honored person’s legacy every time a portion of the fund’s balance is paid out.

<p><b>Jonathan Witt Scholarship:</b> Supports students planning to pursue a health care professional curriculum. The Jonathan Witt Scholarship is actually the oldest scholarship offered, having been continually awarded since the formation of the Hospital Auxiliary organization in the 1950’s. The auxiliary members voted to rename the scholarship in 2004 and established an endowment with the Foundation in honor of Jonathan Witt, son of Dr. Dan and Sandi Witt. <a href="https://clarabartonhospital.com/docs/fnd_sch_app_witt-stalcup.pdf">Click Here to View/Print Application!</a>
